    "1. Since the two resistors are equal, the value is irrelevant. The voltage drops from 4.5V in the first resistor and again 4.5V in the second (short answer: 4.5V). Potential is then raised in the battery from the ground (0) to 9V - closing the circuit.\n",
    "2. The current flowing in the circuit is \n",
    "$$I=\\frac{9(V)}{(1k+3k)(\\Omega)}$$\n",
    "The voltage drop in the $3k$ resistor is simply $\\Delta V=3000\\times I=9\\times\\frac{3}{4}$\n",
    "3. What is the voltage at node 3 of circuit (c)?\n",
    "The same reasoning as in point 2 is used here. Except that one has to compute the equivalent resistor of all the resistors connected in parallel after the $1k$ resistor, which is equal to $2.5k\\Omega$. The total equivalent resistor is then $3.5k\\Omega$. The voltage at node 3 is then $\\Delta V=3000\\times I=9\\times\\frac{2.5}{3.5}$ \n",
    "4. The well-known RC-circuit where $R=1k\\Omega$ and $C=1nF$.\n",
    "5. The capacitor can be considered as charged, typically after 3 time constant ($\\tau=RC$) which is $3\\mu s$. \n",
    "6. The voltage evolves as a function of time thanks to:\n",
    "$$\\Delta V(t)=9\\times\\left(1-exp\\left(\\frac{-t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)$$\n",
    "7. The equivalent capacitor is given by \n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{C_{eq}}=\\frac{1}{1nF}+\\frac{1}{2nF}$$\n",
    "which gives $C_{eq}=\\frac{2}{3}nF$. The charge on **both** top plates of the capacitor is given by $Q=C_{eq}\\times V$ which is equal to $6\\;nC$. The voltage at node 5 is then given by \n",
    "$$V=\\frac{Q}{C}=\\frac{6\\;nC}{2\\;nF}=3V$$\n",
    "The remaining 6V are associated to the other capacitor (6+3=9).\n",
    "8. The energy is given by\n",
    "$$E=\\frac{CV^{2}}{2}=\\frac{(2nF)(3V)^{2}}{2}\\;=9 \\;nJ$$\n",
    "9. Simply 9V (since the capacitor are connected in parallel).\n",
    "10. $E=2\\times\\frac{CV^{2}}{2}=81\\;nJ$\n",
    "11. The voltage is 9V and the resistor is $5k\\Omega$ so the current is given by $I=\\frac{9}{5000}\\;(A)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "12. There are 3 blue ($C=1nF$) capacitors for which $V=9V$, hence, $E=3\\times \\frac{81\\;nJ}{2}$. One blue ($C=1nF$) capacitor for which $V=6V$, hence, $E=18\\;nJ$. The total energy is then $100\\;nJ$."
