    "1. The informative note on the OpAmp of a big company designing ICs has been corrupted by a hacker. You discovered the subtle corruption because your sales (regarding this specific category of product) dropped by an unprecedent 5% (subtle but noticable). The average Joe would have neglected this drop but, as a skilled business engineer, you started an investigation and understood the reason behind these \"moving\" customers: without a proper manual, it was not possible to clarify the product specifications. Your task is to correct the equations in the manual (all of them ?). \n",

    "2. After fixing the problem, you propose to complement this technical note to enlarge your customer perspectives on this product's usages. In addition to the \"non-inverting amplifier\" and the \"inverting amplifier\", you propose a note on the \"inverting integrator\" and the \"inverting differentiator\". Write down your note in the kind of pedagogical style (clarify the name of the circuit, etc.) as the already existing circuits (present in the original manual). Here are the two circuits:\n",
