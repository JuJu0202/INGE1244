    "In course 2, it was mentioned that the NAND gate was said to be **universal** because **every other gate** could be constructed from a collection of appropriately connected NAND gates. For the curious, let us just mention that this result was demonstrated and are known as **De Morgan's laws**. \n",

    "# The IC supply chain\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the IC supply chain, it is worth to dig a little bit further **into** the IC itself. There exists a plethora of ICs, each one dedicated to a specific (and sometimes obscure) task. In addition, each manufacturer has its own **architecture** to **process** (build) the **die**. Our goal in this course is not to get a precise comprehension of peculiar architectures but rather to identify the main steps of the IC **supply chain**. Let us list the different keys words at key steps of the chain. This step-by-step keywords-based methodology is a good practice to understand any electronics-related supply chain. This exercise is really worth doing to clearly identify bottlenecks or shortcuts in the value chain (and for you to realize an impactful work). This knowledge could also be highly valuable in a context of **circular economy**. Indeed, being aware of **all the steps** (with a sufficient and global knowledge of **each** step) could allow you to see how **materials** or **services** can **loop back** in the chain. Your reflexion on the chain could also help to improve its **efficiency**. \n",

    "### Everything starts with an idea: step 1 - Logic design\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fullfil an industrial need, a team of developers identify a logic function that would be **relevent** to realize. Wheither it is a brand new product or an old one deserving updates or improvements. The output of this step is a logic function designed with gates that can manage an arbitrary large number of **bits**. As an example, the output could be the logic function XOR realized with NAND gates (although this one has already be realized many... many times).\n",
    "\n",
    "### From an idea to reality: step 2 - Circuit design\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic function could be implemented into a hydrolic circuit, a mechanical device, ... or an electronic device. This is the most efficient way (compactness, power consumption, etc.) as far as today is concerned so let us design the electric circuit with the electric **symbols**. The output of this step could be the kind of circuit design as the one we realized with Alice and Bob (and switches, bulbs, battery, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### A theoretical \"implementation\": step 3 - layout design\n",
    "\n",
    "If you realize that your logic function will be used in many places of your project, it may be worth realizing it at the nanometer scale and not on, e.g., a PCB with \"huge\" components. To think about a layout, you must be aware of the next steps. In this step, you will design the area where you plan to: modify silicon (**doping**), deposit conductors (**metalization**), growing insulators, etc. To understand this step, let us discuss the following picture (the keyword is **planar**):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 3/memorial.png\" width=\"600\">\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",
    "Modifying the output of this step is extremely critical. From a management point of view, once released, the layout <b>must</b> be \"perfect\". This deadline is really a though one. After this step, we go from <b>conceptual objects</b> to real world <b>fabrication</b>. \n",

    "\n",
    "This step is illustrated during the course. The role of light (UV light with small wavelength is discussed). These masks are extremely high added value products (a **set** of mask can cost up to 100.000€...)\n",
    "\n",

    "(Course activity) Let us go up to the **transistor**. All the steps in the manufacturing process are highly **documented** (log books, etc.) because, appearingly unsignificant changes could lead to dramatic consequences. Discussion: the **contamination** of production lines. A simple modification can take **months** to be approved. Risk mitigation considerations are then relevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From one to many: step 6 - wafer probing and dicing \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is a global verification step. The logic function is tested on every single dice. As presented in course 1, the **yield** in fabrication **must** be extremely high. Indeed, these circuits are practically \"impossible\" to debug for the end-user. A manufacturer with a poor reputation can really quick go bankrupt. \n",

    "### Packaging: step 7 - die attach, wire bonding and encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "See course 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally... step 8 - Product testing\n",
    "\n",
    "The performances of the IC are tested in many experimental conditions. Temperature characterisation, frequency response, response in critical situations, etc. We can then produce the datasheet of the product and start **selling** it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example is the CD4040 (little name of the IC) datasheet: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4040b.pdf?ts=1677178135129&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FCD4040B\n",

    "Nevertheless, as we saw in the last two courses, the **information**, **represented** with **numbers** is nowaday encoded with ON and OFF switches.

    "# Counting with any basis\n",
    "\n",
    "The history presented above is part of the history of the invention of numbers. To count (only **integers**) with an arbitray set of symbols, you have to start with the selection of a **set of symbols**. In mathematics, one formally writes sets with the help of curly brackets: {}. For example, one can consider the following sets: {♣, ♠, ♥, ♦} or {0,1,2,...,9} or {T,F} or ... {0,1}. For the selected set (let us denote the set with the letter $A$), you compute the **cardinality of the set** (that is to say, the number of elements of the set), written $|A|$ (e.g. with A={♣, ♠, ♥, ♦}, we have |A|=4). I can now show you how to read **any** number and thus to count to an arbitrarily large value with an arbitrary large number of **side-by-side** symbols. \n",

    "\n",
    "This way of counting is said to be **counting in \"base\" four** (with five symbols). The base is the number of symbols that are in your set (the same as the cardinality). \n",

    "Base 26 (hexavigesimal) is the arithmetic base using 26 digits/symbols/characters to write numbers. This base can be used with the 26 letters of the alphabet as digits, which makes it possible to numerically encode any word (in both directions: numbers to letters or letters to numbers). The encoding with base 26 uses an arithmetic base change from base 26 to base 10. The words are considered as written in base 26 (with 26 symbols: the 26 letters of the alphabet ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) and converted to base 10. The following <b>encryption key</b> (A=0, AA=00, Z=25, BA=26) is sufficient to decript any word. Considering the following table:\n",

Yes, the numbers will be written in **base 2**. A number expressed in base 2 is called a **binary number**.
