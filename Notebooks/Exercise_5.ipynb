    "As a user of electronic products, you may be familiar with the concept of **black box**. The concept of black box refers to a certain level of abstraction where you do not care about the actual way things are done (implemented), all you care is that there is a relation between the **inputs** and the **outputs**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, from the point of view of investors, a company is a black box. Indeed you can invest money (input) in the company and expect a return on investment (ROI, the output). At this level of abstraction, you do not (and to a certain level, cannot) care about the exact way your money will be converted to more money (or less). \n",

There is a bijection between the output value and the input value. This function ($y(t)=f(x(t))$ - called the **transfer function**) can vary in nature. It can be a bijective deterministic function or a statistical function (static - output described by probability distribution with time-invariant parameter or dynamical - the probability distribution parameters vary with time (the average shifts with time) or the distribution itself that vary. \n",

    "For example, you all, as a group of students, can be represented as a black box regarding the process of learning physics. The output is the grades distribution (average, standard deviation, etc.) and the inputs are multiples (all the courses, the influence of COVID, how good the teacher is, etc). Listing the relevant inputs is an interesting task when trying to understand (or master) a phenomenon. Here is a representation of the aforementioned process (BBENG 2nd year students learning physics).\n",
