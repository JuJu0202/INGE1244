    "A copper wire is an object whose purpose is to transmit electrical signal (power/information/etc.). Let us have a look to several types of wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw copper wire\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest copper wire consists in a copper-full cylinder whose base-radius is much smaller than its heigth. Here is a picture of such wire:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 6/raw_copper.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Such wire is never used in the industry for the simple reason that, due to copper conductivity, two of such wire that touches would cause a **short-circuit**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For such reason, every copper wire is **coated** with an insulator, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) - a plastic polymer that can be extremely **flexible** and presents a high **dielectric breakdown voltage** ($\\sim$40 MV/m). These coated wires are present all around you and look like this:\n",

    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 6/solid_core_wire.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to **four** of such wires, it is possible to realize the following montage (with a switch and an \"two phases\" plug):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 6/wire_inter.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise session is dedicated to the fact that two wires in front of each other also have a capacitance. Indeed, eventhough these are not parallel flat surface, if one applies a difference of potential $V$ between the wires, there will be a finite charge $+Q$ (on one of the wires, say the red one) and a finite opposite charge $-Q$ on the other one (say the blue one).\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacitance can then be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C=\\frac{Q}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a formula that expresses the relation between the capacitance $C$ and all the parameters that could influence the capacitance.\n",

    "<b>Exercise 1</b>: If I double the voltage difference between the two wires, the amount of charge $Q$: (a) Changes thanks to the aforementioned unknown formula? (b) double (c) quadruple (d) need more information.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 2</b>: Can you list the parameters that could appear in the formula of the capacitance $C$?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that one **measures** the capacitance (with an LCR meter - the instrument relevant for such measurement) for the wire system presented above. Note: The switch is said to be **open** when the elements present on each side of the switch are not connected?\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 3</b>: Consider that the switch is open and that one measures the capacitance of the two wire system present on the left part of the switch. It gives a value $C_{1}$ $[F]$. Consider now that the switch is closed. The value $C_{2}$ is measured. $C_{2}$ (when compared to $C_{1}$) is: (a) larger (b) smaller (c) equal to (d) need more information.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 4</b>: Considering the following relation (presented in course 8):\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\Delta C}{C_{0}}=\\frac{\\Delta \\epsilon}{\\epsilon_{0}}+\\frac{\\Delta A}{A_{0}}-\\frac{\\Delta d}{d_{0}}$$\n",
    "When closing the switch, I significantly change: (a) $\\frac{\\Delta \\epsilon}{\\epsilon_{0}}$ (b) $\\frac{\\Delta A}{A_{0}}$ (c) $\\frac{\\Delta d}{d_{0}}$ (d) two of the above terms (e) three of terms (f) need more information.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Such wire system is use to connect a lot of appliances in your home. Suppose that a light bulb (of resistance $R$) is connected between the red and the blue wire, on the left part of the switch. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 5</b>: Supposing that the plug is connected to a $12V$ battery, can you draw the equivalent circuit of this montage (thanks to the different symbols that we encountered so far).\n",

    "Another kind of wire is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 6/pvc_wire.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"flexible conductor\" is made of several small diameter copper wire. This kind of wiring is called **stranded wire** and it is opposed to a **solid core wire**. Here is a representation of these two types of wire:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 6/strandedVSsolid.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",

    "<b>Exercise 6</b>: Based on the above representation, which one, between the stranded and the solid core wire, has the largest resistance ?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of cable is the **coaxial cable**. Such type of cable is ubiquitous in electronics and especially **telecommunications**. Presenting the actual properties and use case of the coaxial cable is far beyond the scope of this exercise session but let us factual present such cable.\n",

    "It consists of on inner copper core (stranded or solid) surrounded by an insulator. The insulator is then encircled by a copper cylindrical shell (\"meshed\" copper on the above figure) which is covered with an outside insulator. From a electric point of view, a coaxial cable can be seen as a **capacitor**. Indeed it corresponds to the definition of the capacitor: **two conductive surfaces in front of one another**. If the inner wire is charged with an electric charge $+Q$, the outer shell gets charges, by electrostatic induction, with a charge $-Q$. The **spacing** between these **charges** (given by the thickness of the insulator - that is a dielectric) leads to a system that presents **potential energy** $V$. The capacitance of the capacitor is defined by the ratio between $Q$ and $V$ (as usual). For the following system,\n",

    "the capacitance is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C=\\frac{2\\pi\\epsilon}{ln\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)}l$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the inner insulator ($\\epsilon=\\epsilon_{R}\\epsilon_{0}$), $b$ the outer cylinder radius, $a$ the inner cylinder radius, $ln$ is the natural logarithm and $l$ the length of the considered cable.

    "\n",
    "For fixed parameters (permittivity and radius), the law is extremely simple as the capacitance is directly proportional to the **length**:\n",

    "# An elementary sensor: data acquisition and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "During last course, we discussed an elementary circuit that can be used to collect information from an elementary **transducer**, i.e. a capacitor whose capacitance variations can be associated to a physical phenomenon (e.g. the water level in a box).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is a fundamental step in electronics, named, **data acquisition**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data acquisition is the process of **sampling** signals that **measure** real-world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data acquisition systems typically **convert** analog waveforms into digital values for processing. This last sentence is the purpose of this exercise session. \n",
    "\n",
    "The components of data acquisition systems include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A sensor**, to convert a physical phenomenon to electrical signals.\n",
    "- **Signal conditioning circuitry**, to convert sensor signals into a form that can be converted to digital values.\n",
    "- Analog-to-digital converters, to convert conditioned sensor signals to digital values.\n",

    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercise 6/data_acqu.jpg\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Data acquisition applications are usually controlled by software programs developed using various general purpose programming languages such as Assembly, BASIC, C, C++, C#, Fortran, Java, LabVIEW, Pascal, Python etc. These are widely used in the industry and you will most probably encounter one of them in your career. \n",

    "# From farad to meters\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise session will be to know the **length** ($l$) of a wire **without** having to measure it with a meter. This experiment appears to be silly for relatively \"short\" wire (of a few meters), but becomes way more relevant for longer one (e.g. a length of 200 meters is already quite long to measure even with a roll meter). \n",
    "\n",
    "The type of wire that we have at our disposal is \"composite wire\", that you can be familiar as it can be used with \"old\" audio/video systems. Here is the cable:\n",
