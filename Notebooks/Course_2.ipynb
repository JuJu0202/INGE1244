    "During the first exercise session, we tried to gain insights on the electronics market. The goal is to dig deeper into the semiconductor industry and the various **processes** at its core. More specifically, I want to present you the **integrated circuit** (IC) value chain from silicon to the final product, the **electronic chip**. This course's most advanced product is the IC but of course, ICs are part of many different and much larger chain of value. You could ask the fundamental business engineering question: **what do we sell as a final product in electronics?** Where does the added value comes? \n",

    "- The materials (silicon, rare earth minerals, gold, etc.)?\n",
    "- The ICs?\n",
    "\n",
    "This market is evolving and growing extremely fast. Without being exhaustive, let us consider the following story (mixing economical and technological developments. We can do businees at different levels. For example, we can start with the management of material stream. For example, extracting **silicon** and realize **silicon wafers**. At another level, by processing silicon wafers, we can realize complex **ICs** (e.g. a processor, a memory chip, photo-sensitive devices, etc.) that can be **assembled** (with a screen, a battery, etc.) on a PCB to manufacture more advanced products, such as **laptops** or **smartphone**. A first trend in electronics was to enhance the computing power of **individuals** by selling increasingly higher performance hardware devices (faster processor, bigger memory, etc.). We are now in the age of **cloud-based services** where the high computing or memory capabilities are **localised** in data centers or satellites. The personal device main capability is to **stream** fluently the flow of data. These data centers allow individuals to access services that they could not **afford** at a personal scale, such as a conversational **artificial intelligence** or a **quantum computing** service. In this part of the course, let us focus on how to make an economy that sells **computational power**.\n",

    "The **history** of electronics is an extremely vast subject (impossible to cover in a single course). Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning a key month: December 1947. It is during this month, on December 16, that the **point-contact transistor** was the first type of **transistor** to be successfully demonstrated. It was developed by research scientists **John Bardeen** and **Walter Brattain** at Bell Laboratories in a group led by physicist **William Shockley**. The introduction of the transistor is often considered one of the most important inventions in history (and these three scientists won the Nobel prize for this discovery). Here is a picture of their first successful prototype: \n",

    "This picture by itself gives you a hint of how rapidly the field of electronics grew regarding miniaturization (allowing their integration in compact devices). Since, as we already discussed, state of the art transistors (\"only\" 75 years later) are built with characteristic lengths of a few **nanometers** (the typical length a tens of silicon atoms **aligned**). At this scale, you have no more intuition of **how small it is**. Considering the relative size of things, the ratio between the smallest modern transistor ($10^{-9}$ m) channel and your thumb ($10^{-1}$ m) is the same as the one between your thumb and the Earth diameter ($10^{7}$ m)! In addition to the figure below where you zoom into the eye of an ant (and you are still far from the nanometer...), we suggest you the following video realized for IBM in 1977: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0&t=195s.\n",

    "For the rest of this notebook, I want for you to stay at the level of <b>phenomenologic understanding</b> of how a transistor works. I do <b>not</b> expect from you (as far as this notebook is concerned) a textbook understanding of voltage, current, electric and magnetic field inside the device etc. These quantities will be inspected more carefully in much simpler devices (such as resistors, capacitances or inductances).\n",

    "# Transistors: what do they do and how to build them ? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to see how transistors work with an extremelly simple description. The Nobel Foundation states that the term \"transistor\" is a combination of the words **\"transfer\"** and **\"resistor\"**. Let us then see, in a nutshell, how a **resistor** works. A resistor is a **passive** two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical **resistance** as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow. The relationship among voltage, current, and resistance is summarized by **Ohm’s law**. Ohm discovered that the current in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage established across the circuit and is inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. In short,\n",
    "$$Current\\; =\\;\\frac{Voltage}{Resistance} $$\n",
    "Or, in units,\n",
    "$$Amperes\\; =\\;\\frac{volts}{ohms} $$\n",
    "So, for a given circuit of constant resistance, current and voltage are proportional to each other. The symbol used for ohms is the greek letter omega $\\Omega$. For a difference of potential (a, so called, voltage), let us use the letter $U$ and $I$ for the current. \n",
    "For example, if your body resistance is 100000 $\\Omega$, how much current will you experience if you touch the terminals of a 12-V battery? (0.00012 A)\n",
    "If your skin is very moist, so that your resistance is only 1000 $\\Omega$, and you again touch the battery terminals, how much current will you experience? (0.012 A, which is hurtful...).\n",
    "A transistor is a peculiar type of resistor in which:\n",
    "- when the transistor is **OFF**, the resistance is (considered as) **infinite** (extremelly large). Looking at **Ohm's law**, we see that: $I=\\frac{U}{R}=\\frac{U}{\\infty}=0$ and so, **No current** goes through the transistor. \n",
    "- when the transistor is **ON**, the resistance is (considered as) **being zero** (extremelly small). Looking at **Ohm's law**, we see that: $U=RI=0*I=0$ and so, **No voltage** can be measure across the transistor.\n",
    "From that prospective, the transistor can be thought to as a simple **switch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 2/switch.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to use this object for some purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Alice and Bob pushing on switches\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the following circuit, where a light bulb is connected to a resistor (zig-zag symbol on the figure below) and a battery. In a parallel montage, two switches are connected in series. The red hand (symbolizing a girl named Alice - for historical reasons) as well as the blue hand (symbolizing a boy named Bob - also historical) have the ability to close their switch (keep in mind that these switches could be implemented with **transistors**). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a figure representing the situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 2/basic_logic.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a configuration (top left) where neither Alice, nor Bob are pressing their switch: the light in **ON**. When Alice closes her switch, nothing changes for the light bulb if Bob's switch is not closed (so is the same for the reversed situation). These situations describe the top right and bottom left configurations: the light bulb is **ON**. Now, let us consider the bottom right configuration where both switches are closed. The light bulb is said to be **short cutted** (i.e. that in this parallel configuration, all the current going through the resistor will go through the resistance-less switches and not through the resistive bulb). In this case, the light bulb is **OFF**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was noted that such a machine (if build) implements a mathematical object which is called a **Truth table** - an object defined by **George Boole** (1815 – 1864), supporting the so-called **Boolean algebra**. The most surprise fact at the time (where differential geometry was living a golden age) was that it was possible to build a rich **algebra** with the elementary notion of **ON or OFF**, **True or False**, **0 volt or 5 volt** or... **0 or 1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To **model** the situation, let us assign a **0** to Alice when her switch is **open** and a **1** when she presses her switch (and let us do the same for Bob). \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "This assigned 0 or 1 is called a <b>single bit of information</b> - specifying wheither the switch is **ON** or **OFF** for the person concerned (Alice or Bob have each a single bit). \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As presented on the above figure, for this specific circuit, there are **four** possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the **important twist**. This **specific** circuit gives, in a **deterministic way**, the following Truth table:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 2/truth_table.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**BUT** **(!!!)**, in general, **any** two bit circuit could give $2\\times2\\times2\\times2=16$ **different** Truth table. Each of these 16 Truth table reprenting a **logical function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one of these tables relates to the **AND** logic function. It is interpreted as follows: the light is **ON** **only** when **both** Alice **AND** Bob press their switch.\n",

    "\n",
    "Observing both Truth table, one can logically connect the first one that we presented to the **AND**. When the light is **ON** in the first one, the light is **OFF** in the second one and **vice-versa**. The first one is then called a **NOT AND** (or NAND for short). In Boolean algebra, these abstract object are called **gates**. We talk about an **AND gate** or a **NAND gate**. Each of the sixteen have their \"little name\".\n",
